Some custom themes for mainsail

Just install the custom.css and background image files to:
```
/home/<username>/printer_data/config/.theme
```
and it will install it to the one you want. If you have multiple klipper instances just put it in each printer like
```
/home/pi/E3_data/config/.theme
/home/pi/S8_data/config/.theme
```
or use different themes on each printer. 
Just delete the files and refresh your browser to turn the theme off.
